# Make effective data visulization
## Summary

The dataset I used for this project is found on Kaggle, which contains wine quality information via 11 variables.
I hope readers of this visualization could get a feel of what are the traits being a wine of quality. From 1 to 8, the higher the rank, the better quality.

## Design

Initially I took the boxplot to show the variable distribution of each quality category. 
I believe that enveil the important traits of wine charactoristics.
