# Make effective data visulization
## Summary

The dataset I used for this project is found on Kaggle, containing air quality information of main Chinese cities from 2010 to 2015. I used the data for Shanghai to explore the impact of differnet weather conditions to the air quality, which is represented by PM2.5.

## Design

Originally I have made line chart to show the seasonality, and scatter plot to reveal the bi-variable correlation, after receiving the comments, I added animation, and color encode to the line charts and scatter plot.
